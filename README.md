# *Project Manager*


**project management system for a small structural engineering firm**

1. The program stores the following information for each project the firm works on:
	* Project number.

	* Project name.

	* What type of building is being designed? E.g. House, apartment block or store, etc.

	* The physical address for the project.

	* ERF number.

	* The total fee being charged for the project.

	* The total amount paid to date.

	* Deadline for the project.

	* The name, telephone number, email address and physical address of the architect for the project.

	* The name, telephone number, email address and physical address of the contractor for the project.

	* The name, telephone number, email address and physical address of the customer for the project.

2. The program does the following:

	* Capture information about new projects. If a project name is not provided
	when the information is captured, name the project using the surname of
	the customer. For example, a house being built by Mike Tyson would be
	called “House Tyson.” An apartment block owned by Jared Goldman would
	be called “Apartment Goldman.”


	* Change the due date of the project.

	* Change the total amount of the fee paid to date.

	* Update a contractor’s contact details.

	* Finalise existing projects. When a project is finalised, the following should
	happen:
		* An invoice should be generated for the client. This invoice should
		contain the customer’s contact details and the total amount that the
		customer must still pay. This amount is calculated by subtracting the
		total amount paid to date from the total fee for the project. If the
		customer has already paid the full fee, an invoice should not be
		generated.
		* The project should be marked as “finalised” and the completion date
		should be added.
